<!--general info about my music tastes and info about my relationship with music-->

<span id="exposition h1"><h1>Let me give some exposition...</h1></span>
<p>Music has been a part of my life for forever, but especially in my middle school and high school years as I became interested in musicals and shows. My go to music was any theatre song...but now I have much broader tastes. I still love musicals to death, but now I also love music from anime, some rap (mostly Nicki Minaj and Hamilton) and even some popular songs. Music from my childhood is also a guilty pleasure of mine (e.g. The Fresh Beat Band and other kiddie songs).</p>
<br>
<span id="relationship h2"><h2>My relationship with music</h2></span>
<p>I listen to music all the time, but not only do I love to listen to music, but I also love to perform too. I love singing in chorus and performing in musicals. I've been in. m y high school's SING productions and the spring musical production in 2019, and I've been singing in chorus since the 6th grade. In middle school; we sang at NYSSMA (New York State School Music Association) competitions, and then in high school I was put in a basic level of chorus but then I got to be in the NYSSMA class. In high school, my teacher awas selective about who got to go to NYSSMA as opposed to middle school where everyone got to go. I was never chosen to go to NYSSMA thus far; the first year of high school I wasn't chosen, and the second year I thought I had a shot at being chosen, but then the COVID-19 epidemic led to the competiton being cancelled. This year, the status of the competition is unknown thus far. Music also stimulates my creativity, as I'm always thinking of songs that fit characeters and scenes that I've created for the different story ideas that I've come up with. I'm not skilled enough to write and compose songs yet, but I hope to get there one day.</p>
