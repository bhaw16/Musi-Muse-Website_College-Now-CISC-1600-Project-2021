# Musi-Muse-Website_College-Now-CISC-1600-Project-2021

This project was for my Bridges to Computing pre-college class at Brooklyn College.
I worked on this project in the fall of 2020 and finished it in January of 2021. I'm probably going to revamp this with some JS
scripts and possibly change up some of the content on the page. Might not get to it anytime soon but all I ask is
that you don't scrutinize the current state of the website.
